1) use of snapshot in Ec2?

ANSWER:

Backup for Your EC2 Instance:
A snapshot is like taking a picture of your EC2 instance. It captures the entire state of your virtual server at a specific moment

Data Protection:
Think of a snapshot as a safety net. If something goes wrong with your instance, you can use the snapshot to restore your data and settings.

Incremental Backups:
Snapshots are smart! They only capture the changes made since the last snapshot. This makes them efficient and saves storage space.

Creating Snapshots:
You can manually create snapshots whenever you want. It's like saying, "Hey, remember how my instance looks right now!" You can also automate this process.

AMI Creation:
Snapshots are often used to create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). An AMI is like a blueprint for your instance, and you can use it to launch new instances with the same setup.

Data Migration:
If you want to move your data to a new instance or a different region, snapshots make it easy. It's like packing up your stuff and moving it to a new house.

EBS Volumes:
Snapshots are commonly associated with Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, which are like virtual hard drives for your EC2 instances. Snapshots allow you to back up these volumes.

Cost Consideration:
While snapshots are handy, remember that they contribute to your storage costs. Deleting old and unnecessary snapshots helps manage costs.

Recovery Point:
If something unexpected happens to your instance, having snapshots is like having a time machine. You can go back to a specific point in time when the snapshot was taken.

Snapshot Retention:
Consider how long you want to keep your snapshots. Some might be short-term backups, while others could be kept for a more extended period for compliance or historical purposes.
So, in a nutshell, snapshots in EC2 are like taking periodic pictures of your virtual server, allowing you to restore, backup, and manage your data efficiently

2) To create a snapshot using the console

 ANSWER: 
 
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots, Create snapshot.

3. For Resource type, choose Volume.

4. For Volume ID, select the volume from which to create the snapshot.

5. The Encryption field indicates the selected volume's encryption status. If the selected volume is encrypted, the snapshot is automatically encrypted using the same KMS key. If the selected volume is unencrypted, the snapshot is not encrypted.

6. (Optional) For Description, enter a brief description for the snapshot.

7. (Optional) To assign custom tags to the snapshot, in the Tags section, choose Add tag, and then enter the key-value pair. You can add up to 50 tags.

8. Choose Create snapshot.


  3) Instance volume limits:

ANSWER:

The maximum number of Amazon EBS volumes that you can attach to an instance depends on the instance type and instance size.
