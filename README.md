1) In aws how many total regions are available?
   -
   ANSWER: 29 REGIONS ARE AVAILABALE IN AWS


2) what are the benefits of EC2 ?
   -
 ANSWER:

 1. Scalability: EC2 allows you to easily scale your computing capacity up or down based on demand. This means you can handle fluctuations in traffic or workload without any hassle.

 2. Flexibility: With EC2, you have the flexibility to choose from various instance types, operating systems, and software packages, enabling you to tailor your computing environment to your specific needs.

 3. Cost-Effectiveness: EC2 offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where you only pay for the computing resources you use. This helps in optimizing costs by eliminating the need for upfront investments in hardware.

 4. Reliability: Amazon EC2 provides a reliable environment by offering high availability and uptime. It also offers features like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to enhance reliability and fault tolerance.

 5. Security: EC2 provides a secure computing environment with features such as security groups, network access control lists, and encryption options. This ensures that your data and applications are protected.

 6. Global Reach: With EC2, you can deploy your applications in multiple geographical regions around the world, allowing you to reach a global audience while ensuring low  and high performance.
  

3) There are three main purchasing options:
   -
ANSWER:

On-Demand Instances: With this option, you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, depending on the instance type, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. It's like paying for electricity; you only pay for what you use.
   
Reserved Instances: Reserved Instances involve making a one-time payment to reserve compute capacity for a specific instance type in a particular region. This option offers significant discounts compared to On-Demand pricing and is best suited for predictable workloads with steady-state usage.
   
Spot Instances:   in AWS offer spare computing capacity at low prices, but they can be interrupted if demand increases or if others bid higher. They're best for flexible, non-urgent tasks like batch processing or testing.


4) Type of Tennency?
   -
ANSWER: 

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. The main tenancy types for EC2 instances are:

Shared Tenancy (default): Instances are launched on physical servers shared with other AWS accounts. This is cost-effective and suitable for most workloads.

Dedicated Tenancy: Instances run on physical servers dedicated to a single AWS account. There are two types:

Dedicated Instances: Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to a single AWS account, but the physical hardware can still be shared with other AWS resources.

Dedicated Hosts: Physical servers are dedicated exclusively to a single AWS account. This offers more control over instance placement and can address specific compliance or regulatory requirements
